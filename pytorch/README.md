## PyTorch implementation of "Deep Metric Learning to Rank"

The PyTorch version of FastAP is being implemented within the framework of 
[Deep-Metric-Learning-Baselines](https://github.com/kunhe/Deep-Metric-Learning-Baselines).
In this repository we provide a standalone implementation of the loss layer.
